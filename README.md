# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis: Understanding Customer Emotions

Unlocking insights from text — this project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyze and classify sentiments (positive, neutral, or negative) expressed in written text.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a deep dive into **sentiment analysis**, also known as **opinion mining**. It leverages custom-built datasets and Python libraries to understand the emotions behind user-generated text, offering valuable insights for:

- Customer Feedback Analysis
- Brand Monitoring
- Product Reviews
- Social Media Sentiment Tracking

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Measure Customer Satisfaction**  
2. **Understand Brand Perception**  
3. **Gather Product Feedback**  
4. **Inform Strategic Business Decisions**

## 🗂️ Dataset

We built a **custom dataset** tailored to:
- Capture emotions of the younger generation.
- Be domain-specific for improved accuracy.
- Minimize biases found in generic datasets.

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Collection** — Tweets, reviews, and social media posts  
2. **Preprocessing** — Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization  
3. **Sentiment Classification** — Using TextBlob, BERT API, and fine-tuned models  
4. **Visualization** — Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: NLTK, TextBlob, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud  
- **APIs**: Google BERT, ChatGPT-4o, Custom Real-time API  
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook

## 🌟 Key Features

- Custom sentiment models tailored for specific domains  
- Real-time sentiment analysis via APIs  
- Integration-ready for chatbots, CRMs, and dashboards  
- Expandable emotion lexicon for deeper emotional context  
- Capable of handling sarcasm and irony (work in progress)

## 📈 Visualizations

- Word Clouds for positive, neutral, and negative texts  
- Bar charts for sentiment distribution
